# CleverTap-Assignment

This project was built as an assignment by CleverTap. This project demonstrates creating and using an Android library - HundeBilder(Dog Images in German).

A simple V-VM approach and Android Jetpack tooling have been used in the app to handle the interaction with the library.

The library contains interface--callbacks which the client app can integrate with. This project utilizes the interface in the VM.

The HundMediator class handles the network calls and the firing of callbacks to clients. A basic approach was taken wrt to time.

Improvements are required in the back and forth between the data and the UI along with the utilization of adequate test cases.
